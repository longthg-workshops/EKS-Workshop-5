**_Attention:_** Cloud 9 has been deprecated and may not be supported for new accounts. We recommend moving to our following alternative solutions.

### How to set up the environment to run the labs in your own AWS account.

1. [Cloud9 (Deprecated and Not Recommended)](2.1.1-cloud9/)
2. [Deploy VSCode as a web app with EC2 and CloudFront](2.1.2-cloud-ide/)
3. [Deploying VSCode on EC2 and access it from your local VSCode](2.1.3-remote-vscode/)
4. Completely deploying on your local setting (connection and responsiveness depends on your region)
